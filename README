The purpose of the course is that the students should use knowledge from the course EDAF15 Algorithm Implementation when writing software for multicores, ie to learn how to implement an algorithm as efficiently as possible on a particular multicore computer, both on a traditional multiprocessor with shared memory, and on multicores where communication is handled explicitly by software, e.g. as with DMA on the Cell processor, and to understand advantages and disadvantages of these two multicore architectures.
